This was a great project to use the R knowledge I acquired during my first year at university. We used open data to answer some key questions about what it is like to live in Glasgow. Then I made some extra plots based on these open databases. As an international student, I was interested in the number of people whose mother tongue is not English. As the database used all the neighbourhoods in the city, I selected those that are more popular among students. Another aspect I was interested in is the way of transport people use in their day-to-day life. Once again, I showcased the areas that are more popular with the students. The GitHub repository containing the RMarkdown on this project is available <a href="https://github.com/zsolttakacs2000/PsychDataChallangeR">here.</a>
