I made this website as part of a group for my Web App Development course. We used a wide range of different technologies to create and develop a website where users can share their favourite hikes and rate other users' routes. The main framework under the website was Django. However, a great deal of HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax and CSS was included for the best user experience.
I was personally responsible for creating the Views, the sitemap and the Forms. I also adjusted the Models to match our ideas the best. Finally, I was also responsible for adding several functionalities to our website, including the comment, like, search and arrange features. Deploying the final project was also my job.
